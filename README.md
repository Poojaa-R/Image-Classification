# Image-Classification

Image classification is the process of detecting image features. This is one of the fastest-growing problems arising with modern technology. I have used several unsupervised learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to classify the images. When the SVM algorithm was used, the accuracy was 93%.
